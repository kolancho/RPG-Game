Code for an RPG Game
There is currently no direct interaction with the player
Each character can be a warrior, mage, or rogue with each of the categories having its own unique qualities
They can attack, defend (randomly generated), cast spells (they are kind of useless because the mage basically does the same with her attack), and level up (gives a bonus to their stats)
